# Franco Toolkit System
(There is no other good name for this at the moment)

**WARNING** This project is in VERY EARLY development

FTS aims to fill the missing gap between developers and desktop applications.
Initially designed for Linux apps, it should easly support Mac and Windows apps as well.
Support for other systems like Raspberry Pi in Framebuffer mode is considered by design.

... and Android!

**Now into more technical details**

FTS is a Java based API to help developers write desktop applications with abstract
user interfaces. Initially any developer with some experience in Android should have
no problem creating FTS applications.

This work is a derivate of a small library that I wrote for [MusicTrans](http://musictransapp.com), and now
I'm extending it for more diverse applications.  

As a reference, it took me only one month to port the code of MusicTrans for Android to Mac/Win/Linux,
and most of the code is shared between these very different systems.
